# analytics-indicator - a.k.a. frontend

This service represents the frontend of the Social Weather Streamer. It listens to the
topic `correlation` and shows the average over all received correlations in the browser
on `http://localhost::8080`.

## Prerequisites

This service requires Java 11. No specific token is needed.

## Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line, type `mvnw` (Windows),
or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux). Then open
`http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction`. This will build a JAR file
with all the dependencies and front-end resources, ready to be deployed. The file can be found in
the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/socialweatherstreamer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Deploying using Docker

To build the Dockerized version of the project, run

```
docker build . -t analyticsindicator:latest
```

Once the Docker image is correctly built, you can test it locally using

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 analyticsindicator:latest
```
